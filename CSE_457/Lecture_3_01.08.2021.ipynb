    "So lets discuss why nmos is downwards(pull-down) and pmos is upwords(pull-up) in a networks. Cause pmos+nmos=cmos. cmos is complementary mos which refers to pmos/cmos will complement each other. This means that when nmos is active pmos will complement nmos, be numb(stop) and vice-versa(this is complementary feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "nmos will take you towards 0(GND) and pmos will take you toward 1(VDD=volt of battery) thus they are pull-down and pull-up network respectively in a cmos. The table is like a confusion matrix. like when pull-down OFF and pull-up ON then output will be 1 and when both are ON then we'll get crowbar which means that the output will continuously jump between 0-1. Crowbar is unwanted condition. When both are OFF we get Z state in which output terminal is free and can be used by anyother bus.\n",

    "This is compound gate where we can see nand and nor gates. So for A.B and C.D nmos will be in series (cz nmos is series for nand gates) after that there's a nor operation between AB & CD for that they need to be connected in parallel (cz nmos is parallel for nor gates). So the nmos/pull-down will look like the following fig.\n",
