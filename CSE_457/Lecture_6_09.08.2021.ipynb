    "Here if each chip's size increases by 10% then considering total size is 100% so the new size will be 110% (after increase). Thus to know how many chips can we fit in the same wafer we divide 500 by 110% or 1.1 . If the dft increase was 20% then 500 would be divided by 120% or 1.2 to get new chip count. And we take integer(floor) version of the division. Increase of area can be calculated in two ways one is size + size * 10% another can be size * total percentage after increase for this case it'll be 0.64 * 110% or 1.1 .\n",
