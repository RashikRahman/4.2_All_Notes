</I></FONT><P>The library contains a set of predefined layout macros such as contacts, devices and pads. Those cells are built according to design rules, and contain size parameters. To invoke the cell library click <B>Edit -&gt; Generate</B>.</P>

<UL>
<LI>CONTACTS such as polysilicon/metal, n-diffusion/metal, p-diffusion/metal and metal/metal2 metal2/Metal3,(etc..), or stacked contacts can be obtained here. You may also click the icon in the palette. Multiple contacts can be generated when entering number of contacts in X and Y greater than one. You may also generate a polarization seal around the contact to create a pad diode protection for example.</LI>
<LI>MOS. This macro generates either a n-channel or a p-channel transistor. The parameters of the cell are the channel length (default value is given by the design rules), its width, and the number of gates. Once those parameters are defined, the device outline appears. Click on the mouse to place it in the appropriate place.</LI>
<LI>PADS. It is possible to add various items such as a single pad, a test pad (usually 30x30 µm), or even a set of pads all around and to the layout using the VDD and VSS power rings. In the last case (adding more than one pad), give the number of pads each side of the chip and if need be modify the width of the VDD and VSS tracks, as well as the number of VDD/VSS pad pairs.</LI>
<LI>PATH. This command generates a path of interconnects using one single layer. The path width can be changed, as well as the alignment to the routing grid. A set of contacts can also be placed at both ends of the path. This command is very useful for VDD and VSS supply drawing and single layer interconnects.</LI>
<LI>BUS. This command generates a set of parallel lines with user-defined layer, width and spacing. This command is useful to build coupled interconnects, or bus path used in the final routing of a chip.</LI></UL>


<UL>
<LI>INDUCTOR. This command generates a coil made from use-defined metal layers. This item is used for very-high frequency oscillators. In MICROWIND2, this inductor is viewed as a simple interconnect as it does not handle inductance. </LI></UL>
