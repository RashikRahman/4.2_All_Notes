    "**LR0 can't handle conflist like s/s,s/r,r/r where s is shift and r is reduce. Here SLR1 parser helps.** In parsing table GOTO section stays same we modify the ACTION section. SLR reduces conflict of LR0 but doesnt fully resolves it. And in ACTION section shift operation is also same like LR0 changes will come in reduce. Unlike LR0 we won't write the whole row with same reduce i.e. r2 (we write r2 as I6 is a production of \"2.S->.aA\" in modified grammer, thus 2 is after r). \n",
    "\n",
    "For the ACTION section reduce function we first calculate first and follow of production. We can use code to generate this. Slight addition to the code part is for production S->AA if we calculate follow(A), for the first A it is followed by another A so we add 2nd A's first to follow(A). Now when we come to 2nd A it isn't followed by anythin and is a nonterminal so we add follow of parrent that is follow(S) to follow(A). follow(S) has dollar in it so we add dollar in follow(A). \n",

In LR0 we wrote r1(As it resemlbes \"1.S->.AA)  in I5's row of action side. But here we'll do some calculation. Here we see the left side of I5's production which is S. Now we check follow(S) and find dollar sign in it. So we write r1 in dollar column,I5 row of action section. As follow(S) doesn't have any other value like a,b so a,b column,I5 row of action section will remain blank.\n",

Now in the first line after shifting the dot we get A. So we add production of A to set. Here the thing is after a there is d,dollar. If we calculate first(d,dollar) we get d cause it is terminal. So we put d in the A's production in set. For the second line there B after dot. And e,dollar is after B so if we calculate first(e,dollar) we get e thus add B's production to set and add e to it.
