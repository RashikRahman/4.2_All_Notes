Here control starts from L43 it goes through line 1 and 2 but when in line 3 there's a statement that shifts the control to L44. So Line 1 to line 3 is considered to be basic block 1 or B1 in short. But if the condition isn't satisfied in line 3 then control moves to line 4 and then ends at line 5. As B1 is declared so this two lines would be in B2. Now line 6 is the only line in L44 so we put it in B3 as the control is shifted by default when we reach a labels end.\n",

Now there's a goto line 3 statement which is a self loop so draw a self loop. Then B4 has line 10-11 and has goto (2) statement which indicates goto Block 2 thus draw a line that shows B4->2.
