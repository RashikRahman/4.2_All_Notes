To init input we write reg instead of input, and for output we write wire. uut means unit under test and pass x,y,o to it as we are using these value for tests. Then we give test case with initial begin command after that to display the results we give values to monitor func after 2nd initial begin command. The # means time delay so #20 means it will start after 20s. And as time is a library module so we use dollar sign before it in monitor func. If we don't delay using # then from the tests it will only take one and discard others as all the test will come in first second. We didn't use display func as it only will give output once. On the other hand monitor func will give output whenever the value changes.\n",
