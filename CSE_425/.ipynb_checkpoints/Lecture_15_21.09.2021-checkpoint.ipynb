As p1 is just below p4 so x's value for these point will be same, and any point on this line will have same x value. same goes for y axis. p4, p3 are on the same line so their y value will be same.

In exm u'll see the regional code of Q1 just as shown in this fig and if your calculated bit value doesn't match with that regional code than there's faulty calculation. This is step 1.\n",
