Thus Ex would be px+1 and Ey would be py as both pixel are in same hieght. NEx would be px+1 and NEy would be py+1. So from a starting pixel we can get any pixel's coordinate value. We get this benifit for equal distance grid.\n",

But drawback of this algo is to find distance we use euclidean distance which incorporates square and root operation. This makes the whole rendering process slow.\n",
