Color info of a frame is stored in a memory and that memory is called frame buffer. And Z value of per pixel are stored in z-buffer. Z value is value of z axis.\n",

    "Now how to calculate z buffer. Take init buffer that has -inf in all pixels, now compare init buffer with triangle image(z values). If new matrix's z values are greater then init z buffer then replace init values with new z values. And thus get resulting matrix. Here -1 is larger then -inf so -inf is replaced by -1. The resulting matrix is now the z buffer. And then again a new image/matrix/buffer comes and the whole process is repeated. This is how we treat each primitive individually. From scene extracty object then extract triangle from object then do this pixel calculation to get z buffer.\n",
