    "So now prob can happen like what if the object is larger then the texture map. Texture map value range is 0 to 1 if an object size exceeds this value what can we do? We can take some typical approaches. In texture repetition we repeat the texture in the object but it has down side that is some artifacts are created near the boundary. So mirroring will give smooth transitions. And clamping adds a fixed value if there's a point outside 0,1. We can also add different color on the part that exceeds the range using border color.\n",

To achieve this we can use stack of texture where we stack different size of textures, so when object size changes like shifting to small or big we can have corresponding texture to it. Select the best fitting polygon size we can choose texture from the stack. As shown in the figure we can store stack multiple sizes of texture.\n",
