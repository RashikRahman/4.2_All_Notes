    "Adding a vector to a point returns new point. If we add p1 with vector then the vector will indicate which direction the new point will be and its value. Let P1 and P2 are two point that are included in vector. Now on this line if we want to calculate P we need the following eqns. In the eqn t is a scaler value and by multipling it we get new length. t's value is between 0->1 cause using 0 we get p1 and using 1 we get p2 in the 1st eqn. Using the 1st eqn we can get every point on line p1->p2.\n",
